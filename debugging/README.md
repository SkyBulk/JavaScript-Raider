# Debugging Scripts

This folder contains different debugging scripts which I use / used during development.
For examples scripts to detect which testcases have a specific property.
Or scripts to display the state of a testcase.

Some scripts maybe don't work at the moment.
Others are very old and are likely not required anymore.
